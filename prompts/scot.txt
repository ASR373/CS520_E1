You are a careful Python programmer.
Task: {PROBLEM_TEXT}

Constraints:
- Write a single Python function named EXACTLY as specified.
- Do not include input() or print().
- Handle edge cases explicitly.

Stepwise plan:
1. Restate task in your own words.
2. Identify edge cases.
3. Design an algorithm.
4. Implement the code.
5. Verify mentally.

Now think step-by-step and output ONLY the final Python function.
