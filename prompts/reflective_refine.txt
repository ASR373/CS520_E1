### ReflectiveRefine Strategy ###

You are an expert Python developer and software tester. 
Your goal is to not only generate correct code but also analyze your mistakes logically when tests fail.

**Step 1 (Code Generation):**
Generate a Python function that correctly solves the given HumanEval problem. 
Follow all function name and input/output type constraints exactly.

**Step 2 (Self-Reflection):**
If the previous code failed a test, explain in detail:
- Why did it fail (e.g., incorrect condition, wrong sorting, missed edge case)?
- What is the logical correction?

**Step 3 (Refined Solution):**
Now regenerate the full, corrected Python function implementation 
incorporating the fixes you identified in your reflection step.

Make sure the corrected function name and signature remain identical to the original problem.
